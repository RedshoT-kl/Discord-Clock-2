Installation:

2. Open up your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repo's directory that you've cloned;
3. Run `npm install`.

Configuration:
Open `config.js` file with your favorite text editor and change all required fields.

Run:

2. Run `node index.js` or `npm start`;
3. Well, technically you're done!.

# Note
> The clock is updated every 10 minutes, so **it is not up-to-date**. Because Discord is now __ratelimiting__ us for _10 minutes_ to change the channel's name!
